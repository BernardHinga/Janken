# Janken

## A small "inspired" project meant as a challenge to myself.

Even simple games that we used to play as kids, and still play now, contain some level of logic that requires a certain degree of a "computation thought process" for a beginner such as myself.

I'm trying to tackle this without the help of any AI platform, <i>(ChatGPT)</i>ðŸ¤«. Doing reaserch and leaning as I move along. A bit rudimentary but at least I get to learn some concepts a little better.ðŸ˜‡
