# Janken

## A small "inspired" project meant as a challenge to myself.

Even simple games that we used to play as kids, and still play now, contain some level of logic that requires a certain degree of a "computation thought process" for a beginner such as myself.

I'm trying to tackle this without the help of any AI platform, <i>(ChatGPT)</i>ðŸ¤«. Doing reaserch and leaning as I move along. A bit rudimentary but at least I get to learn some concepts a little better.ðŸ˜‡

### Logo

The concept of the logo is MINE. I specify to clarify that I have not plaigerised the idea and design. I put in the time to refine and make it as it is now.

<i>The icon/logomark is sourced from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/rock-paper-scissors" title="rock paper scissors icons">Flaticon</a>.</i>

I've taken it upon myself to dub the "R" on it to showcase it in indeed an original concept by myself.
